Dynamic trading website on GitHub that provides users with a virtual capital of one million dollars to engage in the exciting world of stock trading. Users can buy and sell stocks, and they have access to real-time stock data and values, which are displayed using interactive line graphs for easy comparison. To achieve this, the website pulls data from a live API, ensuring that users are always working with up-to-date market information. The back end of the website is powered by Firebase, which securely stores user login information, tracks their portfolios of purchased stocks, and calculates their total assets. This project offers a practical and engaging way for individuals to explore the stock market and refine their trading skills.
